Something of Jesus's very own. The trip had been rocky so far. Sarah's husband, Bill, was distant as ever, and her son, Alex, is disagreeable as usual. Once Sarah gets the goblet, though, everything starts to Change. All of a sudden, Alex is enthusiastic about family events. Sarah soon comes to learn that this is no coincidence. Life starts to change back home as well. Sarah and her children go to church the first Sunday at home-which is a feat in itself-only to discover that Sarah's singing voice is inspiring everyone. The church goers all around her turn and are moved by Sarah's angelic voice, and she joins the church band. Everything is going right for Sarah. Well, almost everything. Her children are making better decisions, the church band is really taking off, but her husband still isn't living up to his obligations. In fact, Sarah discovers evil forces are at work in him, and he is trying to steal the goblet. On a last-minute trip back to Israel, can Sarah save the precious relic before Bill does the unthinkable? Find out in The Goblet.\",\n",
