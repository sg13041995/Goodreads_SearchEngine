The trip had been rocky so far. Sarah's husband, Bill, was distant as ever, and her son, Alex, is disagreeable as usual. Once Sarah gets the goblet, though, everything starts to Change. All of a sudden, Alex is enthusiastic about family events. Sarah soon comes to learn that this is no coincidence. Life starts to change back home as well. Sarah and her children go to church the first Sunday at home-which is a feat in itself-only to discover that Sarah's singing voice is inspiring everyone. The church goers all around her turn and are moved by Sarah's angelic voice, and she joins the church band. Everything is going right for Sarah. Well, almost everything. Her children are making better decisions, the church band is really taking off, but her husband still isn't living up to his obligations. In fact, Sarah discovers evil forces are at work in him, and he is trying to steal the goblet. On a last-minute trip back to Israel, can Sarah save the precious relic before Bill does the unthinkable? Find out in The Goblet.\",\n",

       "  'In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season\\'s premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians\\' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? \\nBut Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a \"nice deserted moor.\" As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators\\' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes \"squealing the names of the players\" as well as \"tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.\" Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland\\'s supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: \"The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field.\"\\nLong before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it\\'s true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry\\'s life, the book\\'s emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This Daily Prophetscoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete. (Ages 9 and older) --Kerry Fried',\n",

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a 2005 fantasy adventure film, based on J. K. Rowling's novel of the same name. The film is the fourth installment in the Harry Potter film series, although 1492 Pictures decided to leave the series. The film was directed by Mike Newell and produced by David Heyman. The screenplay was penned by Steve Kloves. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The film is set during the trio's fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A highly dangerous competition, the Triwizard Tournament, is being held at Hogwarts with only one student from each of the three competing schools selected to take part, but mystery occurs when the Goblet of Fire chooses Harry Potter as a fourth competitor. Filming began in early 2004 and the scenes of Hogwarts took place at the Leavesden Film Studios.\",\n",

       "  'In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season\\'s premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder. Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians\\' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? \\nBut Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a \"nice deserted moor.\" As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators\\' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes \"squealing the names of the players\" as well as \"tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.\" Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland\\'s supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: \"The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field.\"\\nLong before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it\\'s true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry\\'s life, the book\\'s emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This Daily Prophetscoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete. (Ages 9 and older) --Kerry Fried',\n",
